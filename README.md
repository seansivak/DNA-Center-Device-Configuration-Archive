# DNA-Center-Device-Configuration-Archive
This script will take a configuration backup of all Routers, Switches, and WLCs in DNA Center and put the configs in an encrypted zipped file.

The script will prompt you for the DNA Center IP Address.

You will have to update the creds.py file and enter in your username and password.

Ensure you set a complex password to encrypt the the files.  The password must contain an upper and lower case letter, number and one of the following: ;,./~!@#$%^&*()_+{}[]|:?.

The files will be stored in the directory in which the script was executed.  You may want to change the file location in the script.
